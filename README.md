# ehr-radiology-multimodal-ml
Multimodal ML pipeline combining EHR data and radiology images to predict clinical outcomes.

## Objective
Design and implement an end-to-end multimodal ML pipeline integrating structured Electronic Health Records (EHR) and unstructured radiology images for clinical outcome prediction.

## Why It Matters
Combining diverse medical data types improves clinical decision-making accuracy. This project highlights expertise in scalable data engineering, medical imaging, and applied AI.

## Tech Stack
- PySpark for EHR data processing
- MONAI, TorchIO, PyTorch for image processing and modeling
- Docker, AWS EKS for deployment

## Getting Started
Instructions to install dependencies and run the project will be updated soon.
